# OpenCavity

Opencavity is a python package that allows to analyze the eigenmodes of open optical cavities.

What opencavity allows to do:
 
 * Compute both fundamental and higher order eigenmodes of optical resonators.
 
 * Simulate resonators that include optical elements: apertures, diffractive optical elements (DOE), or any arbitrary phase and
 amplitude masks placed anywhere inside the resonator.
 
 * It integrates a physical optics module that allows to compute the output mode, and simulate its propagation outside the resonator. This module can be used for example to design interferometric setups, beam shaping or transforming using DOE.
